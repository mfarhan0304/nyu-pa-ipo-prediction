## üìä **Slide 2: Project Overview & Goals (1.5 minutes)**

### **Speaking Script**
"Our primary objective is to predict IPO performance using machine learning, but we've taken an innovative approach by implementing not one, but two types of models. We have regression models that predict actual closing price values, and classification models that predict whether the price will go up or down. This dual-model approach gives us comprehensive insights into IPO performance from multiple angles."

"To achieve this, we've built a substantial dataset of 3,249 IPO records spanning from 2000 to 2024, with 231 carefully engineered features from multiple data sources. The key innovation here is our multi-source data integration strategy, which combines traditional financial metrics with natural language processing of SEC filing documents."

### **Key Points to Emphasize**
- Explain why dual-model approach is valuable
- Highlight the dataset size and time coverage
- Emphasize the feature engineering complexity
- Connect to business value

## üï∑Ô∏è **Slide 3: Data Sources & Collection (2 minutes)**

### **Speaking Script**
"Let me walk you through our data collection strategy. We start with primary IPO data from NASDAQ APIs, which gives us company information, pricing details, and deal timing. But we don't stop there. We've integrated market context data including the VIX volatility index with full OHLCV data, and Federal funds rate information to capture the economic environment."

"The real game-changer is our SEC filing integration. We automatically download F-1 registration statements from the EDGAR database and apply natural language processing to extract sentiment scores, risk assessments, and financial indicators. This gives us insights that traditional financial metrics simply can't provide."

"Our scraping infrastructure is fully automated with quality controls, rate limiting to respect API limits, and comprehensive error handling. We've collected data from 2000 to 2024, ensuring we capture different market cycles and economic conditions."

### **Key Points to Emphasize**
- Show the comprehensiveness of data sources
- Highlight the NLP innovation
- Emphasize the automated, production-ready approach
- Connect data quality to model performance

## üîß **Slide 4: Data Preprocessing & Integration (2 minutes)**

### **Speaking Script**
"Now, let me show you how we bring all these diverse data sources together. Data preprocessing is where the magic happens. We standardize dates across all sources, handle missing values with sophisticated imputation strategies, and ensure data type consistency. But the real challenge is integration."

"We've developed a multi-source merging strategy that aligns IPO dates with market data using temporal alignment algorithms. Company identification is particularly tricky because NASDAQ and SEC filings use different naming conventions, so we implement fuzzy string matching with manual verification for ambiguous cases."

"The data volume challenge is significant - SEC filings can be massive text files, so we've implemented batch processing and memory management strategies. Our quality assurance includes validation protocols, cross-reference verification, and comprehensive error handling and logging."

### **Key Points to Emphasize**
- Show the complexity of the integration challenge
- Highlight the technical solutions you've developed
- Emphasize data quality and validation
- Demonstrate production-ready thinking

## üî¨ **Slide 5: Feature Engineering (2.5 minutes)**

### **Speaking Script**
"Feature engineering is where we transform raw data into predictive power. We've created 231 features across four main categories. Traditional features include the basics like price, shares, and employees - that's 6 features. Market features add VIX data, Fed funds, and timing indicators - that's 15+ features."

"Here's where it gets interesting: our NLP features from SEC filings include text complexity metrics, sentiment analysis, risk assessment scores, and financial indicators - that's 50+ features. And finally, we create derived features including interactions, ratios, and transformations - that's 100+ features."

"We apply statistical feature selection methods and PCA for dimensionality reduction. The key insight is that NLP processing of SEC filings adds substantial predictive value beyond traditional financial metrics. These text-based features capture nuances about company risk, market positioning, and regulatory compliance that numbers alone can't reveal."

### **Key Points to Emphasize**
- Break down the feature categories clearly
- Show the scale of feature engineering
- Highlight the NLP innovation
- Connect features to predictive power

## ü§ñ **Slide 6: Modelling Approach (2 minutes)**

### **Speaking Script**
"Our dual-model architecture addresses different aspects of IPO prediction. For regression, we implement five models: Linear and Ridge regression as baselines, Random Forest for tree-based approaches, and Gradient Boosting and XGBoost for ensemble methods. These predict actual closing price values."

"For classification, we have four models: Logistic Regression as baseline, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. These predict whether the price will go up or down. Our training strategy uses an 80/20 train/test split with 5-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation."

"The beauty of this approach is that we can compare different algorithmic families and understand which approaches work best for IPO prediction. We select the best model based on performance metrics - R¬≤ for regression and accuracy for classification."

### **Key Points to Emphasize**
- Explain the dual-model logic
- Show the variety of algorithms
- Highlight the robust evaluation strategy
- Connect model selection to performance

## üß™ **Slide 7: Testing & Validation (1.5 minutes)**

### **Speaking Script**
"Robust evaluation is crucial for financial applications. We use an 80/20 train/test split with stratification for classification to maintain class distribution. Our 5-fold cross-validation provides stability analysis and helps us understand model reliability."

"For regression, we track R¬≤, RMSE, and MAE. For classification, we monitor accuracy, precision, and recall. But most importantly, we implement out-of-sample testing to ensure true generalization capability."

"We maintain reproducibility with fixed random states and consistent evaluation protocols. This comprehensive validation approach gives us confidence that our models will perform well on unseen data, which is critical for real-world deployment."

### **Key Points to Emphasize**
- Emphasize the importance of robust evaluation
- Show the comprehensive metrics you track
- Highlight reproducibility and generalization
- Connect to real-world deployment

## üìà **Slide 8: Results & Performance (2.5 minutes)**

### **Speaking Script**
"Now for the results that matter. Our best regression model, Gradient Boosting, achieves an impressive 80.47% R¬≤ score, with Random Forest close behind at 78.85% R¬≤. This demonstrates strong predictive power for actual closing prices."

"Classification performance is more modest, with XGBoost achieving 71.23% accuracy. The key insight here is that regression models significantly outperform classification models for this task. This suggests that predicting exact price values is more feasible than predicting binary direction."

"Feature importance analysis reveals that market context features, particularly VIX data, show high importance. NLP features contribute significantly, validating our approach of processing SEC filings. Traditional features like price and shares remain important, but the interaction features add substantial value."

### **Key Points to Emphasize**
- Highlight the strong regression performance
- Address the classification challenges honestly
- Show which features are most important
- Connect results to business value
