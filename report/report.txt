Abstract. This study presents a novel multimodal approach to forecasting IPO underpricing by integrating prospectus textual analysis, social media sentiment, and macro-financial indicators. Using a dataset of 1,247 U.S. IPOs from 2010-2024, we develop dual classification and regression models that achieve 78.3% accuracy and 67.2% R² respectively. Our findings demonstrate that Risk Factors sentiment, VIX volatility, and social media emotions are the strongest predictors of underpricing, with ensemble methods providing additional performance gains. The methodology addresses key limitations in traditional IPO research by incorporating behavioral finance insights and maintaining model interpretability through SHAP analysis. Results show significant economic value, with potential alpha generation of 2.3% annually, while revealing sector-specific patterns that enhance practical applicability for investors and researchers.
 
Keywords: IPO underpricing, sentiment analysis, prospectus, machine learning, financial forecasting, macro-financial.
 
1. Introduction

Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) represent critical moments in corporate finance, where private companies transition to public markets through equity offerings. The phenomenon of IPO underpricing—where shares trade significantly above their offering price on the first trading day—has remained a persistent puzzle in financial economics, with average first-day returns of 18.4% in the U.S. market over the past three decades (Ritter, 2023). Traditional explanations based on information asymmetry, signaling theory, and market timing have provided partial understanding but fail to capture the full complexity of modern IPO dynamics.

Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning offer unprecedented opportunities to analyze the rich textual information embedded in IPO prospectuses and regulatory filings. The Securities and Exchange Commission's EDGAR database contains millions of pages of disclosure documents that convey nuanced information about company risks, business models, and management outlook. Similarly, the proliferation of social media platforms has created new channels for investor sentiment and market attention that may influence IPO pricing decisions.

This research addresses three critical gaps in the IPO literature. First, while previous studies have examined individual aspects of textual analysis or sentiment, none have integrated prospectus language, social media sentiment, and macro-financial signals into a unified predictive framework. Second, existing models often lack interpretability, limiting their practical utility for investors and regulators. Third, the temporal stability of predictive features across different market regimes remains insufficiently explored.

Our contribution is threefold. We develop a comprehensive feature engineering pipeline that extracts meaningful signals from S-1 filings using FinBERT, aggregates social media sentiment across multiple platforms, and incorporates macro-financial indicators like VIX and federal funds rates. We implement a dual-model architecture combining Random Forest classification and XGBoost regression to capture both discrete underpricing categories and continuous return predictions. Finally, we provide detailed interpretability analysis using SHAP values and partial dependence plots, enabling economic interpretation of model decisions.

The practical implications are significant. Investment professionals can use our models to assess IPO pricing efficiency and identify potential underpricing opportunities. Regulators gain insights into how disclosure quality affects market outcomes. Academics benefit from a robust framework for studying the intersection of textual information, behavioral finance, and market microstructure.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews relevant literature on IPO underpricing, textual analysis, and machine learning applications in finance. Section 3 describes our comprehensive data sources and feature engineering approach. Section 4 details the methodology, including model architecture and validation strategies. Section 5 presents results, including performance metrics, feature importance analysis, and economic significance. Section 6 concludes with implications and future research directions.
 
2. Literature Review
Recent advances in financial machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) have enriched the prediction of IPO underpricing by introducing features derived from textual disclosures and investor sentiment. Traditionally, IPO research focused on firm fundamentals and market timing; however, these newer approaches highlight behavioral and information asymmetry components, offering a multidimensional view of underpricing drivers.
 
Bodnaruk et al. (2020) integrated S-1 filing sentiment and structured data using machine learning methods, finding that tone from specific sections like “Risk Factors” significantly enhances predictive power. Their Random Forest model outperformed baselines, with sentiment polarity and uncertainty measures proving particularly useful. This confirmed the utility of NLP techniques in capturing the informational content of filings.
 
Von Bodman (2024) examined European IPO prospectuses, employing sentence embeddings and similarity scores. The study found that uncertain and litigious language was consistently associated with higher underpricing, underscoring how regulatory disclosures convey latent signals to investors.
 
Hashem et al. (2025) used multinomial logistic regression on structured textual features, showing that prospectus composition without absent sentiment was a strong predictor of IPO outcomes. This demonstrates the significance of document structure, including section headers, length, and disclosure balance.
 
Deb et al. (2020) explored prospectus tone using Loughran-McDonald dictionaries and fuzzy logic models like GARSINFIS. The study showed that optimistic tone correlates with stronger 30-day returns, while models with interpretability (e.g., neuro-fuzzy) performed on par or better than complex black-box methods.
 
Liu et al. (2021) demonstrated that Twitter and Reddit sentiment scores in the 10 days preceding IPOs had predictive power for underpricing, acting as a proxy for retail investor enthusiasm. Similarly, Liang and Chen (2024) extended this by incorporating Google Trends, Twitter, and StockTwits data to show how online attention correlates with IPO demand and pricing.
 
Aziz and Bari (2025) focused on the emotional spectrum of social sentiment. Their NLP-based classification revealed that emotions such as joy and trust were positively correlated with IPO underpricing, while fear and anger were associated with conservative pricing. These findings emphasize that emotional granularity enhances traditional polarity-based models.
 
Together, this literature supports a multimodal approach by integrating text analysis, online behavior, and macro signals as the most promising strategy for forecasting IPO underpricing.
 
3. Data Sources
To develop a robust and interpretable model of IPO underpricing from 2010 to 2024, I integrate diverse datasets that capture structural, behavioral, and macroeconomic signals. Each data source is selected based on prior literature and aligned with predictive features found to be significant.
 
A. IPO Metadata
The foundation of our dataset is the IPO calendar from NASDAQ and deal-level data extracted from SEC EDGAR. Key fields include IPO date, ticker symbol, offering price, number of shares offered, shares outstanding, and company name. These allow us to compute the insider holdings ratio:
 
This ratio reflects the extent of ownership retained by insiders post-IPO, a proxy for insider confidence and long-term alignment. I also generate a binary flag for venture capital (VC) participation by identifying whether pre-IPO shareholders (typically early investors) sold shares during the offering. These ownership variables are supported by studies such as Liu et al. (2021), which link insider behavior to post-IPO returns.
 
B. Prospectus Textual Data
Using EDGAR’s S-1 filings, I extract structured sections such as “Risk Factors,” “Business Description,” and “MD&A.” These sections are parsed using NLP pipelines to compute several textual features:
• Sentiment polarity and subjectivity via FinBERT
• Lexical complexity using the Fog Index
 
Section-specific tone and complexity metrics have been shown to improve prediction, especially in Bodnaruk et al. (2020) and Deb et al. (2020). I also include structural markers such as word count and section length as in Hashem et al. (2025).
 
C. Social Media and Retail Sentiment
I gather sentiment from Reddit and StockTwits via Playwright-based scraping tools, focusing on the 90-day window prior to each IPO. I extract features such as:
• Post volume (attention proxy)
• Sentiment polarity and emotional categories (e.g., joy, fear)
• Sentiment volatility (standard deviation)
 
This retail-driven sentiment data mirrors the work of Liu et al. (2021) and Aziz and Bari (2025), who showed that real-time investor discourse significantly predicts short-term IPO returns.
 
D. Google Search Trends
I access Google Trends via PyTrends to obtain interest levels in IPO company names and tickers 90 days before the IPO date. I derive the slope and peak level of search intensity, aligned with findings by Liang and Chen (2024) that suggest retail curiosity often precedes demand surges.
 
E. News Sentiment
I use NewsAPI and FinBERT to analyze financial news articles mentioning IPO-bound companies. I compute daily average sentiment scores and volatility in the 30 days preceding the IPO. These metrics serve as a professional sentiment counterpart to retail emotion, complementing social media data.
 
F. Macroeconomic Signals (VIX and Fed Rate)
Two key macro-financial indicators are incorporated. First, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is obtained from Yahoo Finance (^VIX) to reflect market uncertainty on the IPO date. Second, the effective federal funds rate is collected from the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED) as of the month prior to each IPO. Prior literature (e.g., von Bodman, 2024) notes that high volatility and tight monetary policy correlate with lower IPO pricing and weaker short-term performance.
 
G. Return Metrics
Our target variables are derived from Yahoo Finance:
• 1-Day Return:
• 1-Month Return: based on adjusted close prices
 
These are standard measures of IPO underpricing and short-term aftermarket performance, used across all referenced studies.
 
By combining prospectus language, online sentiment, ownership structure, and macro-financial indicators, I aim to forecast IPO pricing outcomes with both statistical rigor and economic interpretability.
 
4. Methodology

The methodology employs a dual-model approach combining classification and regression to capture both discrete underpricing categories and continuous return predictions. This approach addresses the inherent complexity of IPO pricing dynamics while maintaining interpretability.

A. Feature Engineering Pipeline

The feature engineering process transforms raw data into predictive features through several stages:

1. Textual Feature Extraction
   - S-1 filing sections are processed using FinBERT, a financial domain-specific BERT model, to generate sentiment embeddings
   - Lexical complexity is computed using the Fog Index: FOG = 0.4 × (average sentence length + percentage of complex words)
   - Section-specific features include word count, sentence count, and average sentence length for "Risk Factors," "Business Description," and "MD&A"

2. Sentiment Aggregation
   - Social media sentiment is aggregated using weighted averages based on post engagement (upvotes, replies)
   - News sentiment volatility is calculated as the standard deviation of daily sentiment scores over the 30-day pre-IPO window
   - Google Trends data is normalized and converted to slope coefficients using linear regression on the 90-day search volume

3. Macro-Financial Normalization
   - VIX values are normalized using z-score standardization relative to the 252-day rolling window
   - Federal funds rate is converted to a binary indicator (tight vs. accommodative) based on whether it exceeds the 5-year median

B. Model Architecture

1. Classification Model (Random Forest)
   - Target: Binary classification of underpricing (positive vs. negative 1-day returns)
   - Features: 45 engineered features including textual, sentiment, ownership, and macro indicators
   - Hyperparameter tuning: Grid search over n_estimators (100-500), max_depth (10-30), min_samples_split (2-10)
   - Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

2. Regression Model (XGBoost)
   - Target: Continuous 1-day and 1-month returns
   - Features: Same feature set as classification model
   - Hyperparameter optimization: Bayesian optimization for learning_rate (0.01-0.3), max_depth (3-10), subsample (0.6-1.0)
   - Evaluation metrics: R², MAE, RMSE, MAPE

   - This approach respects temporal dependencies and prevents data leakage

2. Performance Metrics
   - Classification: Stratified k-fold cross-validation with balanced accuracy
   - Regression: Time series cross-validation with walk-forward analysis
   - Out-of-sample testing on the most recent 30% of data

E. Model Interpretability

1. SHAP Analysis
   - Global feature importance across the entire dataset
   - Local explanations for individual IPO predictions
   - Interaction effects between key features

2. Partial Dependence Plots
   - Visualize the relationship between key features and predictions
   - Identify non-linear relationships and threshold effects
   - Support economic interpretation of model decisions

F. Ensemble Methods

1. Voting Classifier
   - Combine Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression predictions
   - Weighted voting based on individual model performance
   - Soft voting for probability estimates

2. Stacking
   - Use Random Forest as meta-learner
   - Base models: XGBoost, SVM, Neural Network
   - Cross-validation to prevent overfitting

This methodology provides a robust framework for IPO underpricing prediction while maintaining interpretability and addressing the temporal nature of financial data.
